# The scenario

After a very successfull Open Doors day in 2023, a school has been swarmed with applications and Information requests

Among those, a request for a Student and Course Database from the school board, fearing to be overwhelmed with inscriptions.

In order to save costs, the school decided to create the Front End software themselves and tasked you with creating an API that allows to associate students, their respective promotions and coaches as well as courses to be associated.

# Components of the Software

A way to hold students and their associated courses as well as coaches and their associated Courses in order to correlate these 2 values

A Way to group Students into promotions with start and end Dates

A way to Save, retrieve and modify information from a Database.

A Database.

In order to achieve that, we will make use of a very popular Framework called Spring.
