## What are Arrays in Java

Put Simply Arrays are objects that can store a predefined number of elements of a same type.

And therein lies the problem.

Up until now we dealt with Arrays because we always knew how many Students, Coaches, Courses etc we had to deal with. Thus an array was the perfect fit. Now, with a database running behind it,we do not know how many entries we are going to have and hence we need a dynamic way of storing Elements.
