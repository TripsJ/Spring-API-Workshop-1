## What is Spring

Spring is the most popular Java Framework
It can take most of the object generation and initialisation out of your hands.
It also provides a lot of annotations to make complex developement tasks a breeze.
On top of Spring, a lot of starter packages were developped to facilitate dependency management.
A lot of those starte packager have been included into Spring Boot.

## How to get Started

it's fairly simple to get started,
Go to https://start.spring.io

### Spring boot and Spring initializer

The Website you are currently on is the Spring Initializer

![Spring Initializer](https://github.com/TripsJ/Spring-API-Workshop-1/blob/main/0_Resources/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230330141920.png)

Add Spring Web to the dependencies
Also add Lombok to the dependencies

if we need anything else, we can still add them later

Next Set the Project to Maven and the Language to Java

Select the Heighest Stable Spring Boot Version available. For Stabillity Avoid Snapshot and Release Candidates (M2) versions

For the Metadata, by convention the group is a reverse domain name and the artifact is the Name of the package.
For the sake of this Workshop i chose

    Group: org.workshop.spring

    Artifact: CourseApi

    Name: CourseApi

    Description:

    Package name: org.workshop.spring.CourseApi

select packaging to Jar and your Java version to the highest avaidable.
20 at the time of writing.

Finally click on Generate and Save the resulting Zip file to your harddrive.
Extract it to a folder.

This is the Starting point of your Project. No more manual Package creation, the configuration is also created for us and the included dependencies are at the latest version already.
