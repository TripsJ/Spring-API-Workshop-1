In our discussion of objects, i showed you what a Student class could look like if we were to completely write it from scratch, and while a lot of this code can nowadays be generated with your IDE, it is still necessary to understand what the different statements do and why they are useful.

## The Student Class

``` java

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Student {

// Fields

private String username;

private Promotion promotion;

private String orientation;

private Course[] courses;

private Coach[] responsibleCoaches;

//getters and Setters

public String getUsername() {

return username;

}

public void setUsername(String username) {

this.username = username;

}

public Promotion getPromotion() {

return promotion;

}

public void setPromotion(Promotion promotion) {

this.promotion = promotion;

}

public String getOrientation() {

return orientation;

}

public void setOrientation(String orientation) {

this.orientation = orientation;

}

public Course[] getCourses() {

return courses;

}

public void setCourses(Course[] courses) {

this.courses = courses;

}

public Coach[] getResponsibleCoaches() {

return responsibleCoaches;

}

public void setResponsibleCoaches(Coach[] responsibleCoaches) {

this.responsibleCoaches = responsibleCoaches;

}

public Student(String username, Promotion promotion, String orientation, Course[] courses,

Coach[] responsibleCoaches) {

super();

this.username = username;

this.promotion = promotion;

this.orientation = orientation;

this.courses = courses;

this.responsibleCoaches = responsibleCoaches;

}

@Override

public String toString() {

return "Student [username=" + username + ", promotion=" + promotion + ", orientation=" + orientation

+ ", courses=" + Arrays.toString(courses) + ", responsibleCoaches="

+ Arrays.toString(responsibleCoaches) + "]";

}

}
```

### Import statements

``` java
import java.util.Arrays;
```

Import statements are javas way of accessing code from different packages.
We will need a lot of those but luckily modern Java IDE's like Eclipse complain underline missing imports, allowing you to import those with a click. by simply hovering over it with your mouse.

### Getters and Setters

``` java
public Promotion getPromotion() {

return promotion;

}

public void setPromotion(Promotion promotion) {

this.promotion = promotion;

}
```

methods like this are used to access private variables and modify them. modern IDE's, again, can automatically generate the basic getters and setters. We will talk about them again later, when i show you how to eliminate them completely.

### The constructor

``` java
public Student(String username, Promotion promotion, String orientation, Course[] courses,

Coach[] responsibleCoaches) {

super();

this.username = username;

this.promotion = promotion;

this.orientation = orientation;

this.courses = courses;

this.responsibleCoaches = responsibleCoaches;
```

The constructor tells Java how to build an object of a certain class

this: this is the keyword that refers to the current instance (the object created) of the class

super(): This statement calls the constructor of the parent class of an object.
Java supports inheritance, wich allows to pass Attributes and methods to other objects.

### the toString method()

``` java
public String toString() {

return "Student [username=" + username + ", promotion=" + promotion + ", orientation=" + orientation

+ ", courses=" + Arrays.toString(courses) + ", responsibleCoaches="

+ Arrays.toString(responsibleCoaches) + "]";

}
```

The toString() method defines how an object is represented when passed to a print statement. These are also pretty standard and can be generated by your IDE.

All this is basically boilerplate code and Java developers figured that for some applications, that makes code unreadable so they developped ways around it.
